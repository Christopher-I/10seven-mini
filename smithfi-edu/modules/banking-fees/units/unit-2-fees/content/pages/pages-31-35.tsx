              There has been a significant increase in the number of fees since the 1990s as banks continually put their profits over the well-being of their customers. The average overdraft charge in 1998 was $21.57; by the mid-2000s the standard fee was $35 (Servon, 2017); today the average overdraft is closer to $26 according to a study conducted by Bankrate. From fees for paper statements, checks, and replacement cards, banks have found many sneaky but legal ways to make extra money (Servon, 2017).

While the number has gone down over recent years, 4.2% of US households (or 5.6M households) are considered unbanked or underbanked. A household is considered unbanked if no one in the household has a savings or checking account with a bank or credit union.

              AFIs and AFS play a role for individuals underserved by traditional banking, but it's important for consumers to be aware of the possible outcomes of engaging with these institutions. As we've learned, the traditional banking system can make it difficult for many consumers, so it makes sense why some choose AFIs and AFS. We hope this information will help you feel better equipped to navigate the experiences if you choose to engage with these types of institutions and the implications of doing so.

      description: 'Wells Fargo paid $203M out to customers in California after a federal judge found that the bank had "manipulated transactions" to charge more overdraft fees. Essentially, they were practicing debit resequencing (Martin and Lieber, 2010; Alsup, 2010).',
      judgeQuote: `Overdraft fees are the second-largest source of revenue for Wells Fargo's consumer deposits group, the division of the bank dedicated to providing customers with checking accounts, savings accounts, and debit cards. The revenue generated from these fees has been massive. In California alone, Wells Fargo assessed over $1.4 billion in overdraft penalties between 2005 and 2007. Only spread income â€” money the bank generated using deposited funds â€” produced more revenue.

This "including and deleting" practice involved the inclusion and deletion of pending debit-card transactions in the calculation of a customer's available balance. This action does not challenge the amount of a single overdraft fee (currently $35). That is accepted as a given. Rather, the essence of this case is that Wells Fargo has devised a bookkeeping device to turn what would ordinarily be one overdraft into as many as ten overdrafts, thereby dramatically multiplying the number of fees the bank can extract from a single mistake. The draconian impact of this bookkeeping device has then been exacerbated through closely allied practices specifically "engineered" â€” as the bank put it â€” to multiply the adverse impact of this bookkeeping device. These neat tricks generated colossal sums per year in additional overdraft fees, just as the internal bank memos had predicted. The bank went to considerable effort to hide these manipulations while constructing a facade of phony disclosure. This order holds that these manipulations were and continue to be unfair and deceptive in violation of Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code. For the certified class of California depositors, the bookkeeping device will be enjoined and restitution ordered (Alsup, 2010).`

                In 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidance around surprise overdraft fees and depositor fees, suggesting they may violate the Consumer Financial Protection Act if consumers cannot reasonably avoid getting charged (CFPB). A more recent move by the CFPB in 2024 sought to cap overdraft fees at $5 (CFPB, 2024), which was scheduled to take effect on 10/1/2025. However, the Trump administration reversed this ruling, and banks are still allowed to charge you what they want when they overdraft (Bell, 2025).

              Revenue across banks from overdraft fees has been cut significantly in recent years due to many larger banks changing their fee practices (likely after getting hit with lawsuits and dealing with very unhappy customers) (CFPB 2024).

              Some banks that have eliminated overdraft fees and overdraft include Capital One, Ally Bank, Citibank and Alliant Credit Union (Vise, 2025).

                These accounts may be advertised as completely fee-free, and that likely is the case. However, there are likely tradeoffs. For example, many of these accounts do not have all of the features of traditional checking accounts, such as they cannot complete money transfers like wires or you are not able to get checks for those accounts. While these are an alternative option, we invite you to compare these accounts to the other offered accounts and consider which account best meets your needs.
