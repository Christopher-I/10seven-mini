Subject: Fund Your Future CMS Enhancements - 3 Options

Hi [Client Name],

I've created proposals for the CMS enhancements we discussed:

**Option 1: Approval Workflow** - $2,450
Add Editor/Publisher roles with review process before publishing.

**Option 2: Demo Mode** - $1,500
Create a 3-page demo (Dashboard + About + Whack-a-Mole) for presentations.

**Option 3: Bundle (Both)** - $3,750
Get both features and save $200.

I'd recommend the **bundle** - you get complete platform control (internal + external) at the best value. But all three options are attached so you can see what fits your needs.

Quick summary:
- Bundle saves you $200 + gives 3 weeks support (vs 2)
- Faster timeline (parallel development)
- Complete solution ready in 4-5 weeks

Can we schedule 15 minutes this week to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]
