### 7. Sponsorship Opportunities

**Description:** Partner with financial institutions to sponsor free or subsidized access for institutions.

**Model:** Similar to EverFi's approach
- Financial institution sponsors institution's license
- Institution gets free or reduced-cost access
- Sponsor receives brand visibility (ethical, non-intrusive)

**Pricing:**
- Sponsor pays: **$30,000 - $50,000/institution** (premium over standard pricing)
- Institution pays: **$0 - $10,000** (heavily subsidized)
- 10Seven benefits from higher revenue + easier sales

**Revenue Potential:**
- 5 sponsored institutions × $40,000 = **$200,000/year**
