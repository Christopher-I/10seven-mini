# Security Note - API Keys

## Actions Taken to Secure API Keys

### ✅ Completed Security Measures

1. **Removed Figma API Data**
   - Deleted `figma_design.json` file containing API responses
   - File is no longer in the repository

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added patterns to exclude Figma files
   - Added patterns to exclude API key files
   - Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data

3. **Created Environment Variable Template**
   - `.env.local.example` file created
   - Shows structure without exposing actual keys
   - Instructions for proper key management

4. **Verified Git History**
   - No Figma API keys found in commit history
   - No sensitive data has been pushed to repository

## Best Practices Going Forward

### For API Keys:
1. **Never commit API keys** - Always use environment variables
2. **Use .env.local** - This file is gitignored by default
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - If exposed, regenerate immediately
4. **Limit key permissions** - Use read-only keys when possible

### For Figma Integration:
```javascript
// Safe way to use Figma API
const FIGMA_TOKEN = process.env.FIGMA_API_TOKEN;
const FIGMA_FILE = process.env.FIGMA_FILE_KEY;

// Never do this:
// const token = "figd_xxxxx"; // EXPOSED!
```

### Environment Setup:
1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your actual keys to `.env.local`
3. Never commit `.env.local`

## Current Status

✅ **SECURE** - No API keys are exposed in the codebase or git history

## If Keys Were Exposed

If you suspect keys were exposed:
1. **Immediately revoke** the exposed keys
2. **Generate new keys** from Figma settings
3. **Update** `.env.local` with new keys
4. **Review** git history for other exposures
