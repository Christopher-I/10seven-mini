# UX Improvements: Fund Your Future Platform

## Executive Summary

The current prototype has a solid technical foundation but needs significant UX improvements for clarity and ease of use. Users face information overload, unclear navigation paths, and lack of onboarding guidance.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **New User Experience**

**Problem**: Empty dashboard with no guidance
**Impact**: Users don't know where to start
**Solution**: Add onboarding flow and "Recommended Path"

### 2. **Information Overload**

**Problem**: Too much text before users can start learning
**Impact**: Decision paralysis, cognitive overload
**Solution**: Progressive disclosure, simplified cards

### 3. **Unclear Navigation**

**Problem**: Inconsistent breadcrumbs and navigation patterns
**Impact**: Users get lost, can't find their way back
**Solution**: Standardized navigation component

### 4. **Missing Content Context**

**Problem**: No preview of what learning experience looks like
**Impact**: Users don't understand value proposition
**Solution**: Activity previews, screenshots, samples

  description="Click on fees as they appear"
  thumbnail="/previews/whack-a-mole.png"
  onTryDemo={() => openModal()}
/>
```

### 6. Improve Information Architecture

- Show estimated time per page, not just per unit
- Add "skill tags" to show what you'll learn

### 7. Mobile Optimization

## Conclusion

The platform has excellent technical architecture but needs UX polish for effective user engagement. Focus on simplifying the initial experience and adding content to make the value proposition clear.

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 days to implement critical improvements, 1 week for high-priority items.

**Risk**: Without these improvements, users may abandon the platform before experiencing the core learning value.
