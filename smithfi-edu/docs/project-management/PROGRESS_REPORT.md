### üü° **MEDIUM RISK - MONITORING REQUIRED**
1. **Timeline Pressure:** Nov 30 deadline with significant scope remaining
2. **Testing Coverage:** Accessibility and cross-browser testing pending
3. **Performance Optimization:** Not yet implemented for scale

### ‚úÖ **LOW RISK - ON TRACK**

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Client Content Delivery:** Units 3-5 content needed by October 15 to meet timeline
2. **Smith College IT Response:** SAML configuration details needed for SSO integration
3. **Desktop Design Delivery:** Kenny to complete final desktop designs
4. **Scope Clarification:** Confirm priority of missing interactive components
5. **SSO Decision:** Continue with basic auth or wait for full SSO before launch?

### **Timeline Considerations**
- **Current trajectory:** Foundation and 2 units by November 30
- **Full scope delivery:** Would require timeline extension to January 2026
- **Recommended approach:** Implement contingency plan from proposal (defer Unit 5 if needed)

### **Quality vs Scope Trade-offs**
- Strong technical foundation enables rapid scaling once content is available
- High-quality interactive components provide excellent user experience
- Consider focusing on Units 1-3 for November launch, Units 4-5 as Phase 2
