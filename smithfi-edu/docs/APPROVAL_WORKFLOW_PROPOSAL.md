# Multi-User Approval Workflow Enhancement
**Fund Your Future Platform CMS**

**For:** Smith College - Fund Your Future
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Investment:** $2,450

---

## What You Get

**The Problem:** Anyone with admin access can edit and publish content immediately. As your team grows, you need quality control before content goes live to students.

**The Solution:** Add Editor and Publisher roles with a review workflow.

```
EDITOR                  PUBLISHER               STUDENTS
Creates content    →    Reviews & approves  →   See published content
Submits for review      Publishes or rejects    Quality guaranteed
```

---

## How It Works

### Three Simple Steps

**1. Editors Create**
- Write and edit content
- Submit for review when ready
- Get feedback if changes needed

**2. Publishers Review**
- See pending submissions
- Compare current vs. proposed changes
- Approve or request revisions

**3. Content Goes Live**
- Only approved content publishes
- Complete history of who changed what
- Roll back if needed

---

## The Value

### What This Saves You

**Without Workflow:**
- 😰 Accidental publishes → 2-4 hours emergency fixes
- 📧 Email coordination → 30 min per content change
- 🔍 "Who changed this?" → 10-20 min detective work
- ⚠️ Quality concerns → stress and rework

**With Workflow:**
- ✅ No accidental publishes (automatic review required)
- ✅ No email coordination (system handles it)
- ✅ Instant audit trail (always know who changed what)
- ✅ Quality assured (second set of eyes on everything)

**Conservative Estimate:**
Save 5-10 hours/month = $200-400 in time value

**Payback Period:** 6-12 months
