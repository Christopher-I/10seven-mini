# Session Context - Fund Your Future Demo Mode Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Repository:** git@github.com:Christopher-I/10seven-mini.git
**Branch:** main

## Session Summary

This session continued work on the Fund Your Future educational platform, focusing on completing the demo mode implementation and fixing deployment issues.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Demo Mode Button Placement Adjustments
- **Initial Change:** Moved "Play Whackamole Game" button to top of About page
- **Final Change:** Moved button back to bottom of About page (user preference)
- **Location:** `/app/about/page.tsx` lines 392-437
- **Commit:** `4d09983` - "Move Play Whackamole Game button back to bottom of About page"

### 2. Fixed TypeScript/ESLint Build Errors
Fixed all build errors that were preventing deployment:

**app/demo/whackamole/page.tsx (lines 13, 15):**
- Changed `any` types to `unknown` for better type safety
- Fixed ESLint errors: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`

**app/page.tsx (line 23):**
- Removed unused `user` and `userProfile` variables
- Removed unused `useAuth` import
- Fixed ESLint warnings: `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`

**Result:** ✅ Build now compiles successfully
**Commit:** `5a69b96` - "Fix TypeScript/ESLint errors: replace any with unknown, remove unused variables"

### 3. Cleaned Up Navigation
- Removed duplicate navigation buttons from bottom of whackamole game page
- Now only shows "Back to About" and "Dashboard" buttons at the top
- **Location:** `/app/demo/whackamole/page.tsx`
- **Commit:** `0aca11a` - "Remove bottom navigation from whackamole game page"

### 4. Identified Vercel Deployment Issue
**Problem:** Demo mode works locally but not on Vercel deployment
**Cause:** Environment variables in `.env.local` are not deployed to Vercel
**Solution Required:** Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## Current State

### Git Status
- **Branch:** main
- **Latest Commit:** `0aca11a` - "Remove bottom navigation from whackamole game page"
- **Status:** Working tree clean, all changes pushed to remote

### Demo Mode Configuration

**Local Environment Variables (`.env.local`):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SKIP_AUTH=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SKIP_ANALYTICS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SKIP_PROGRESS=true
```

**Demo Flow:**
1. Dashboard → Shows single "Demo App" card
2. Click Demo App → Goes to About page
3. Scroll to bottom → "Play Whackamole Game" button
4. Click button → Whackamole game at `/demo/whackamole`
5. Top navigation → "Back to About" and "Dashboard" buttons

### Key Files Modified in This Session
1. `/app/about/page.tsx` - Game button placement
2. `/app/demo/whackamole/page.tsx` - TypeScript fixes, navigation cleanup
3. `/app/page.tsx` - Removed unused imports and variables

### Build Status
✅ **npm run build** - Passes successfully
✅ **TypeScript compilation** - No errors
✅ **ESLint** - Only pre-existing warnings in admin/debug pages (non-blocking)

## Pending Actions

### IMMEDIATE: Fix Vercel Deployment

The app on Vercel is showing the full app instead of demo mode because environment variables need to be configured.

**Steps to Fix:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit https://vercel.com
   - Select the `fund-your-future` project

2. **Add Environment Variables** (Settings → Environment Variables)

   | Variable Name | Value | Environments |
   |---------------|-------|--------------|
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` | `true` | Production, Preview, Development |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SKIP_AUTH` | `true` | Production, Preview, Development |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SKIP_ANALYTICS` | `true` | Production, Preview, Development |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_SKIP_PROGRESS` | `true` | Production, Preview, Development |

3. **Redeploy**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click (...) on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait for build to complete

4. **Verify**
   - Visit deployed URL
   - Should see single "Demo App" card on dashboard
   - Should see "DEMO MODE" indicator in header

## Next Session Checklist

When you return:

1. ✅ Check if Vercel environment variables have been set
2. ✅ Verify demo mode is working on deployed site
3. ⏳ Test the complete demo flow on production:
   - Dashboard shows single Demo App card
   - Demo App card links to About page
   - About page shows game button at bottom
   - Game button opens Whackamole game
   - Navigation buttons work correctly
4. ⏳ Consider adding more demo content/games if needed

## Questions to Address Next Session
- Do you want to add more demo games/activities?
- Should demo mode be permanent or toggleable?
- Any styling adjustments needed for the demo experience?

## Important Notes
- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` and won't be deployed
- All demo mode code is feature-flagged and can be disabled
- Full app functionality is preserved and can be restored by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false`
- Build is clean and passing with no blocking errors
