### Subject: Fund Your Future - SAML SSO Integration Requirements

```
Hi [Smith IT Contact],

Thanks for the Shibboleth SAML details. We're moving forward with the integration and just want to confirm a few items to ensure compatibility:

Authentication Flow

Does Smith require IdP-initiated SAML flows, or are SP-initiated flows sufficient? Specifically, can users log in directly at fundyourfuture.edu, or should they always go through a campus portal?

SAML Attributes

Could you provide the exact attribute names for:

ERP system unique identifier

User roles/affiliations (single value or array format?)

Email address (NameID or separate attribute?)

Any other useful attributes (department, etc.)

Role Updates

How often do user roles change during a semester, and how quickly should changes reflect in Fund Your Future?

Technical Details

Your Shibboleth IdP entity ID

Any requirements for our SP entity ID format

Timeline for staging environment testing

This will help us configure our Service Provider correctly.

Thanks again for your help,
Chris
```

## Critical Questions Analysis

### Question Priority Matrix

| Question | Priority | Firebase Impact | Custom Impact |
|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| IdP vs SP-initiated | üî¥ CRITICAL | Deal-breaker | Supported |
| Attribute names | üü° HIGH | Implementation | Implementation |
| Role update frequency | üü° HIGH | Expectation setting | Feature planning |
| Entity ID format | üü¢ MEDIUM | Configuration | Configuration |

### Expected Responses & Next Steps

**If SP-initiated flows are sufficient:**
‚úÖ Proceed with Firebase Identity Platform (Option A)
- Upgrade to Blaze plan
- Configure SAML provider
- Implement beforeSignIn function

**If IdP-initiated flows are required:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Switch to Custom Implementation (Option B)
- Implement Next.js SAML handlers
- Manual certificate management
- 2-3 week timeline

**If real-time role updates are required:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Consider Custom Implementation (Option B)
- Firebase updates roles only on next login
- Custom implementation can sync immediately

## Follow-up Communication Templates

### If They Choose SP-Initiated (Option A Path)

```
Subject: Fund Your Future - Moving Forward with Firebase SAML Integration

Hi [Name],

Perfect! SP-initiated flows work great for our implementation.

Next steps:
1. We'll configure our Firebase SAML Service Provider
2. Generate and send you our SP metadata
3. Schedule staging environment testing

Timeline: Ready for metadata exchange within 3-5 business days.

Best regards,
Chris
```

### If They Require IdP-Initiated (Option B Path)

```
Subject: Fund Your Future - Custom SAML Implementation for IdP-Initiated Flows

Hi [Name],

Thanks for clarifying the IdP-initiated requirement. We'll implement a custom SAML solution to support campus portal integration.

Next steps:
1. Develop custom SAML Service Provider (2-3 weeks)
2. Generate and send you our SP metadata
3. Schedule staging environment testing

Timeline: Ready for metadata exchange within 2-3 weeks.

Best regards,
Chris
```
