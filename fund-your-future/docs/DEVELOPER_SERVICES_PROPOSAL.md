---

#### **Option B: Hybrid Model (Aligned Incentives)** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Structure:** $5,000/month base + 8% of monthly revenue

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if I run out of hours in a month?
**A:** You have two options:
1. **Pay for overage hours** at $150/hour
2. **Roll tasks to next month** (if not time-sensitive)

I'll notify you when we're approaching the hour limit so there are no surprises.

---

### Q: Can we adjust the retainer mid-year?
**A:** Rates are fixed for the annual contract term. However, we can adjust:
- **Scope** (reduce tasks if you want to stay under hour limit)
- **Hours** (increase retainer if you need more hours consistently)
- Annual review allows formal rate/scope changes

---

### Q: What happens if I want to pause development?
**A:** For temporary pauses (1-3 months):
- Switch to **Maintenance-Only Tier** ($2,500/month)
- Covers bug fixes, security updates, infrastructure
- No active development

For longer pauses (3+ months):
- Terminate agreement with 60 days notice
- Can re-engage later (subject to availability)

---

### Q: What if we get a big new client and need rush development?
**A:** A few options:
1. **Use overage hours** (billed at $150/hour)
2. **Temporarily increase retainer** for that month
3. **Pre-purchase hour blocks** (e.g., buy 20 extra hours upfront at discounted rate)

I'm flexible and can prioritize urgent work.

---

### Q: How do you track hours?
**A:** I use [Toggl/Harvest/Clockify] to track all time by task/category. You receive:
- **Monthly time log** with detailed breakdown
- **Invoice** showing hours used vs. retainer limit
- **Transparency** into what I'm working on

---

### Q: What if the platform gets acquired or you pivot?
**A:** The contract allows either party to terminate with 60 days notice. If your business changes direction, we can part ways professionally with proper transition period.

---

### Q: Can we do equity instead of cash?
**A:** Potentially! I'm open to discussing:
- **Partial equity** (e.g., $4,000/month + 5% equity)
- **Deferred compensation** (lower rate now, equity at exit)
- **Profit sharing** (percentage of net profit instead of revenue)

Let's discuss if this interests you.

---

## Investment Perspective

### What You're Really Buying

**Not just developer hours, but:**
- ‚úÖ **Institutional knowledge** (I built this platform from scratch)
- ‚úÖ **Continuity** (no onboarding, no knowledge loss)
- ‚úÖ **Speed** (I can build features 2-3x faster than new developer)
- ‚úÖ **Quality** (proven track record, clean code)
- ‚úÖ **Partnership** (invested in your success, not just a vendor)

---

### Return on Investment

**Scenario:** You sign 5 new clients in Year 1 at $22,000 each = $110,000 revenue

**Your Investment in Me:** $72,000 (Year 1 retainer)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Revenue from platform: $110,000
- Developer costs: $72,000
- Gross margin: $38,000 (35% margin)

**But Also Consider:**
- Without ongoing development, you can't sell "6-module platform"
- Module 1 only might sell for $12K (not $22K)
- Competitive advantage from new features (white-label, analytics, custom content)

**Real ROI:** The platform **generates revenue**. My development enables you to sell and scale.

---

## Conclusion

This proposal offers a **win-win partnership structure**:

**For You:**
- Affordable Year 1 pricing during cash-flow negative phase
- Scales with your revenue growth
- Predictable costs and clear deliverables
- Developer continuity (I built the platform)

**For Me:**
- Fair market-rate compensation (by Year 2-3)
- Predictable income and long-term relationship

I'm excited to continue building Fund Your Future together and seeing it make a real impact on students' financial literacy.
